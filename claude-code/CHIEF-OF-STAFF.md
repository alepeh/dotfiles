# Chief-of-Staff Agent

A semi-autonomous daily briefing loop built on Claude Code slash commands and four MCP integrations: Gmail, Google Calendar, Todoist, and Obsidian.

## Design Principles

- **Request-response, not a daemon.** Claude Code is not an event-driven system. The agent runs when you invoke it, not continuously. No webhooks, no push notifications.
- **Human in the loop.** The agent reads freely but never acts without approval. Emails are drafted, never sent. Tasks are proposed, then confirmed. Calendar is read-only.
- **Obsidian is the state store.** There is no separate database. The daily journal (`journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) persists state between runs via structured headings.
- **Idempotent re-runs.** Running a command twice on the same day replaces the existing section rather than duplicating it.

## Commands

| Command | When | What it does |
|---------|------|--------------|
| `/morning-brief` | Start of day | Fetches Gmail, Calendar, Todoist, yesterday's journal. Synthesises priorities. Writes to Obsidian. Presents approval queue. |
| `/evening-recap` | End of day | Compares morning plan vs. reality. Logs completions and carry-overs. Flags escalations. Updates follow-ups for tomorrow. |

## Data Sources

| Source | MCP Tool | What's fetched | Limits |
|--------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Gmail | `query_gmail_emails` | Unread, last 24h (morning) / 12h (evening) | 25 / 15 emails, subject+sender only |
| Calendar | `get_calendar_events` | Today + tomorrow (morning) / today only (evening) | All events |
| Todoist | `find-tasks-by-date` | Due today + overdue | 30 tasks |
| Todoist | `find-completed-tasks` | Completed today (evening only) | By completion date |
| Obsidian | `obsidian_get_file_contents` | Yesterday's journal, recent journals for patterns | Headings + relevant sections only |

## Journal Structure

Each daily journal (`journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) accumulates the following headings over the course of a day. Not all will be present — only those generated by actual runs.

# Evening Recap

### Completed Today
🟢 Task A
🟢 Task B

### Still Open
🔴 Task C — was URGENT, blocked by ...
🟡 Task D — OPERATIVE, carry to tomorrow

### Escalations
- Task E has been overdue for 5 days — reprioritize?

### Tomorrow's Setup
**URGENT**
- ...
**OPERATIVE**

## CoS Feedback
(User writes corrections here manually — agent reads on next run)
```

## Priority Categories

Items are grouped into three categories instead of a flat priority list:

| Category | What belongs here | Urgency |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **URGENT** | Overdue tasks, today's hard deadlines, emails needing same-day reply | Must act today |
| **OPERATIVE** | Ongoing business, routine follow-ups, this week's deadlines | This week |
| **STRATEGIC** | Longer-term items, recurring themes, items that keep slipping | Important but not urgent |

## Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning | When used |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 🔴 | Overdue / was URGENT and still not done | Task overview, evening "Still Open" |
| 🟡 | Due today/this week, high priority (p1/p2) / OPERATIVE carry-over | Task overview, evening "Still Open" |
| 🟢 | In progress or completed | Task overview, evening "Completed Today" |
| ⚪ | Planned for later / STRATEGIC, no change expected | Task overview, evening "Still Open" |

## Implicit To-Do Detection

Emails that don't explicitly ask for something but *imply* an action get flagged. Examples:

- Vendor sends product documentation → "Review documents, check Austrian certification"
- Client mentions a problem in passing → "Follow up on reported issue"
- Colleague shares a link without comment → "Review shared resource"

These appear in the approval queue as suggestions, never auto-created.

## Escalation Logic (Evening Recap)

The evening recap flags items that show signs of stalling:

| Trigger | Message |
|---------|---------|
| Task overdue 3+ days | "This task has been open for N days — reprioritize, delegate, or drop?" |
| Same topic rescheduled 3+ times | "This keeps getting pushed — is there a blocker?" |
| Many overdue items in one project | "[Project] has N overdue items — is this project stalled?" |

## Feedback Loop

```
Morning Brief                Evening Recap              Next Morning
     |                            |                          |
     |  writes Decisions          |  appends Decisions       |
     |  writes Follow-up          |  replaces Follow-up      |
     |                            |                          |
     |                            |     CoS Feedback         |
     |                            |     (user writes         |
     |                            |      manually)           |
     |                            |           |              |
     +----------------------------+-----------+--> reads all three
```

- **Decisions**: Accumulates throughout the day. Morning writes initial entries, evening appends.
- **Follow-up Next Session**: Evening replaces with the final list. Next morning reads it.
- **CoS Feedback**: User writes corrections/preferences at any time. Next run reads and applies them.

## Pattern Recognition

The morning brief scans the last 3-5 journal entries for recurring topics. If a theme appears 3+ times, it gets flagged:

> "Recurring theme: Zulassungsprüfung — appeared 3 times recently. Consider creating a dedicated project or systematic approach."

This catches items that keep surfacing but never get properly tracked.

## Todoist Conventions

- **Label**: All agent-created tasks use the `chief-of-staff` label
- **Dedup**: Before creating a task, the agent searches for existing tasks with the same label and similar content
- **Carry-overs**: Evening recap offers to reschedule existing tasks or create new ones for tomorrow

## Guardrails

| Action | Permission |
|--------|-----------|
| Read Gmail, Calendar, Todoist, Obsidian | Auto — no approval needed |
| Append/patch Obsidian journal headings | Auto — no approval needed |
| Create Todoist tasks (with `chief-of-staff` label) | After approval in conversation |
| Create Gmail draft (subject prefixed `[CoS Draft]`) | After approval in conversation |
| Send Gmail | Never — always draft only |
| Create/modify calendar events | Never — flag for manual action |
| Delete anything (tasks, emails, notes) | Never |

## Context Window Management

The commands are designed to stay within context limits on a typical day:

| Data | Cap | Strategy |
|------|-----|----------|
| Emails | 25 morning / 15 evening | Subject + sender + snippet only, no full bodies |
| Tasks | 30 | Content + project + priority + due date |
| Calendar | All events | Title + time + one-line context |
| Journal reads | Headings + sections | Skip large entries, read only CoS-relevant headings |
| Recent journals (pattern scan) | 3-5 entries | Headings and Follow-up sections only |

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Scheduled CLI Runs

Once prompts are dialled in, automate via launchd:

```bash
claude -p "$(cat ~/.claude/commands/morning-brief.md)" \
  --allowedTools "mcp__mcp-gsuite__*,mcp__mcp-obsidian__*,mcp__todoist__*" \
  --output-format json > /tmp/morning-brief-$(date +%F).json
```

- 07:30 morning brief, 18:00 evening recap
- macOS notification via `osascript` when done
- Approval items written to Obsidian; user processes in next interactive session

### Phase 3: Interactive Sessions

Use Cowork or Claude web for tasks needing back-and-forth:
- Meeting prep (user confirms which meetings need prep packs)
- Email drafting (user reviews each draft)
- Weekly planning sessions
