# Update Roadmap Status

1. Read ROADMAP.md
2. Check `git log --oneline -20` for recent commits since the last roadmap update
3. Cross-reference completed work with roadmap items
4. Update statuses accordingly (mark completed items, note in-progress work)
5. Ask me if there are new items to add or priorities to change
6. Show me a diff-style summary of changes before writing
7. Commit the roadmap update separately from any code changes
