# End-of-Session Retrospective

Review the current session and capture learnings for future work.

## Steps

1. **Review session activity**
   - Run `git log --oneline -15` to see this session's commits
   - Check TaskList for completed and remaining tasks
   - Note what was accomplished vs. what was planned

2. **Gather learnings** — Ask me using AskUserQuestion:
   - What worked well this session?
   - What was challenging or took longer than expected?
   - Any key insights or decisions worth recording?

3. **Update ROADMAP.md**
   - Ensure all completed work is reflected in "Recently Completed"
   - Add any new items or priority changes that emerged during the session
   - Update notes on in-progress items with current status

4. **Optionally create Obsidian note**
   - Ask if I want a session note saved to Obsidian
   - If yes, create a note via MCP with: date, what was done, learnings, and next priorities
   - Use a consistent naming pattern: `Session - YYYY-MM-DD - [brief topic]`

5. **Summarize next priorities**
   - List the top 2-3 items to tackle next session
   - Note any blockers or decisions needed before continuing
   - Mention if any tasks are mid-progress and need resuming

6. **Commit roadmap updates** separately from any code changes
