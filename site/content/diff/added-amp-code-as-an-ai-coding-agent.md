Added [amp](https://ampcode.com/) by Sourcegraph as a third AI coding agent alongside Claude Code and Codex. A new `make amp` target handles the setup, and Amp automatically gets the same MCP servers (Obsidian, Google Sheets, GSuite) wired up that the other coding agents already use. I'm looking forward to exploring it — their vision of the future of agentic AI aligns with my views as well (for better or worse) — but I don't expect I'll switch from my current Claude Max subscription anytime soon.
