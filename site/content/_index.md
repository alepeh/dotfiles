title: "Alexander Pehm"

I'm a developer from Austria. I currently work as a Principal Architect at [Paysafe](https://www.paysafe.com/), where I focus on building distributed systems at scale.

Lately, most of my thinking revolves around agentic AI — using LLMs not just as tools but as collaborators in software engineering workflows. I write about that [here](writing/).

I also happen to run a century-old chimney sweep business. It's about as far from distributed systems as you can get, and that's part of why I like it.

This [repo](https://github.com/alepeh/dotfiles) is my toolbox — opinionated configs for a keyboard-driven terminal IDE on macOS, built around Helix, Zellij, Yazi, and Claude Code.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/alepeh) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderpehm/).
